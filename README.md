# ðŸŒ€ Spring AOP Demo Project

This is a  demonstration of **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** using the **Spring Framework**. It showcases how to modularize cross-cutting concerns like logging, exception handling, and performance monitoring using Spring AOP.

## What is Spring AOP?

Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that allows you to isolate secondary or supporting functions from the main business logic. This helps in writing cleaner, more maintainable code.

### Key Concepts

| Concept        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Aspect**     | A module that encapsulates behaviors affecting multiple classes (e.g., logging). |
| **Advice**     | The action taken by an aspect at a join point (e.g., `@Before`, `@After`). |
| **JoinPoint**  | A point during execution (e.g., method call) where advice can be applied. |
| **Pointcut**   | An expression that matches join points. |
| **Weaving**    | The process of linking aspects with other application types. |
